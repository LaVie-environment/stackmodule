Function getStack creates and returns a new stack as an empty list

Function top returns the top item of a stack without removing it.

Functions push and pop provide the essential stack operations.
The push function pushes an item on the stack by appending it to the end of the list.

If either pop or top are called on an empty stack, the special value None is returned.
